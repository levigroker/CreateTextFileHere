Create Text File Here
===

A manually activated Script to create a text file at the current Finder location
with [BBEdit](http://www.bbedit.com/)  
By Levi Brown <mailto:levigroker@gmail.com>  
Version 1.1 March 31, 2015

This script works in tandem with the 'bbedit' command line binary (which should
already be installed and functional at `/usr/local/bin/bbedit`).

**Please Note**: This script has been tested on Mac OS X 10.7.1 through 10.10.2 under
US English and may contain i18n issues which are not accounted for.

#### Installation

The intention is for this script to be accessed from the currently active Finder
window and acts on the current directory in the Finder. I suggest adding this
script to the a Finder window's shelf (command-drag it into a Finder window at the top
where the other tool icons are located) so it is available from the Finder as
needed. Alternatively, it could be activated from the [Script Menu](https://iworkautomation.com/numbers/script-menu.html).

Download the zip archive from this repository, unzip, and place wherever you like (see above).
