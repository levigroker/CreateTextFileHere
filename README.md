[Create Text File Here](https://github.com/levigroker/CreateTextFileHere)
===

A manually activated Script to create a text file at the current Finder location
with [BBEdit](http://www.bbedit.com/)  
By Levi Brown <mailto:levi@kitefish.net>  
Version 2.0 2025-03-14

This script works in tandem with [BBEdit](http://www.bbedit.com/) (which should
already be installed and functional).

**Please Note**: This script has been tested on Mac OS X 10.7.1 through 15.3.2 under
US English and may contain i18n issues which are not accounted for.

#### Installation

The intention is for this script to be accessed from the currently active Finder
window and acts on the current directory in the Finder. I suggest adding this
script to the a Finder window's shelf (command-drag it into a Finder window at the top
where the other tool icons are located) so it is available from the Finder as
needed. Alternatively, it could be activated from the [Script Menu](https://support.apple.com/guide/script-editor/access-scripts-using-the-script-menu-scpedt27975/mac).

Download the zip archive from this repository, unzip, and place wherever you like (see above).
