Create Text File Here
A manually activated Script to create a text file at the current Finder location
with BBEdit (see BBEdit homepage http://www.bbedit.com/ )
By Levi Brown <mailto:levi@grokers.net>
Version 1.0 September 8th, 2011

This script works in tandem with the 'bbedit' command line binary (which should
already be installed and functional).

The intention is for this script to be accessed from the currently active Finder
window and acts on the current directory in the Finder. I suggest adding this
script to the a Finder window's shelf (drag it into a Finder window at the top
where the other tool icons are located) so it is available from the Finder as
needed.

* This script has been tested on Mac OS X 10.7.1 under US English and may
contain i18n issues which are not accounted for.

Please feel free to contact me with improvements and feedback.
